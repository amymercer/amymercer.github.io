            I'm an experienced education professional with a passion for helping students with diverse learning needs
            succeed. Prior to my career in education, I spent sixteen years leading digital transformations at two
            organizations: first, an online nationwide florist that I helped to co-found, leading us to become the
            third-largest florist in the country, and then in a similar role with Neighborhood Alliance, a local
            non-profit.

            I followed my passion and pursued my Masters, and I've spent the last fourteen years of my career as an
            educator, first in a role with the foremost school for students with ASD in the country and later serving in
            a role helping underprivileged students in the Elyria School District with special needs learn how to read
            and write, and succeed in the classroom.

            I love teaching, and I love education. My combined experience in education and business allows me to bring a
            unique perspective to educational environments, focusing on both student success and organizational
            efficiency.
